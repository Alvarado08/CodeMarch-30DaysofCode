                    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
                    CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
                    CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
                    External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

                    Tailwind CSS is an open source CSS framework. The main feature of this library is that, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, 
                    it does not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables. 
                    Instead, it creates a list of "utility" CSS classes that can be used to style each element by mixing and matching.

                    Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. 
                    It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, 
                    and other interface components
